def lexer()
    returns token, token_value = instance of token (lexeme)

implement FSA for tokens
    identifier and integers, others can be written extra

write REs
draw FSA for above required tokens (identifier and integer)
    put this into document called FSA_mydesign.doc

print result into 2 columns, one for token and one for lexemes
    save result into output.txt

    ex.

    token       lexeme
    keyword     while
    separator   ()
    identifier  t
    real        22.00

readme should include documentation and how to setup program

resulting files should have input_scode.txt, design_file, program_file, output_file, readme_file
